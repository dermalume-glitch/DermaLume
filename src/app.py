# app.py
# -----------------------------
# A tiny Flask app that serves an existing front-end (already in /static)
# and exposes a /predict API that uses a pre-trained ML model from /models.
#
# ðŸ”§ What you need to know / change (if needed):
# - The app will try to load a model from:
#       models/model.pkl   (pickle)
#   then models/model.joblib (joblib)
#   You can keep both; the first one found will be used.
# - FEATURE_ORDER below lists the input features and their order expected by the model.
#   Update FEATURE_ORDER if your model expects different features or a different order.
#
# ðŸ“¨ EXAMPLE REQUEST to POST /predict (send JSON):
# {
#   "dx": "benign or harmfull",
#   "age": "adolescence, adults, elderly",
#   "sex": "male or female",
#   "localization": "back, arm, face, chest, upper/lower extremity, scalp, abdomen, ear, truck"
# }
#
# âœ… EXAMPLE RESPONSE:
# {
#   "prediction": "will churn"
# }
#
# Notes:
# - This example assumes a classification model that returns a class label.
# - If your model returns a number, it will still be returned as a string for safety.
# - Errors return JSON with a message and a 400 status code, so the app won't crash.
